# Date/Time converter chrome extension for developers.

Very light Chrome xtension to convert epoch in millisecond to local and UTC date.

I did that extension because I needed to quickly get human readable dates from some API response.

It's a very simple extension, vanilla JavaScript. I will add more features depending on my needs or on user requests.

## How it works

Add the extenstion, then select a date in ms and click on the extension icon. You can set a shortcut in chrome://extensions/configureCommands

## Help

If anyone knows how to set "Activate the extension" keyboard shortcut in manifest.json, please let me know :)

Any designer to make it nicer?
